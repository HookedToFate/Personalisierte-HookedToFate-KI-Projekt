# PROJECTS INDEX

**Purpose:** Navigation for all creative and system projects. Master list remains `PROJECT_CATALOG.md`.

## Contents
- `PROJECT_CATALOG.md` — 14 projects with status, activation commands, dependencies.
- `creative/` — Placeholder for per-world docs (Wunderhaus, Nyssa, Memory-Room, Spiegelsaal, Nyssa-Codex).
- `system/` — Placeholder for framework docs (Prompt Modifier, OMEGA VM, Chimera Protocol, Profile Guardian, etc.).

## Usage
- When invoking a project, apply its local rules (see catalog). Project logic overrides generic defaults when in conflict.
- Future work: split catalog into per-project files and back-link RECALL IDs.
