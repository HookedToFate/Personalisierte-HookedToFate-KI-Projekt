# PROJECT CATALOG

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 24. November 2025  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive overview of all active and planned projects in Andre's personalized AI ecosystem

---

## Overview

This catalog documents **13 core projects** across Andre's cognitive and creative landscape. Projects are categorized by function: **Creative Worlds** (narrative/character development), **System Development** (tools/frameworks), and **Meta-Structures** (architecture/memory). Each project represents a persistent context that the AI must respect when invoked.

**Key Principle:** When a project is mentioned, its local rules apply (e.g., magic logic in Nyssa vs. physics in OMEGA VM). All insights are stored persistently and cross-referenced via the Memory Layer.

---

## Category I: Creative Worlds

### 1. Wunderhaus (Story-Adventure)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Narrative adventure framework centered on a sentient, shifting house with impossible architecture. Core mechanic: rooms change based on emotional states and unresolved conflicts. Combines psychological exploration with fantasy worldbuilding.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 2000-2099 (Interessen: Spieldesign, psychologische Systeme)  
**Context:** Character logic prioritizes emotional coherence over plot convenience. AI maintains continuity across sessions, tracks character arcs, suggests branching paths based on past choices.

---

### 2. Nyssa (Charakter-Entwicklung)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Central character project — Nyssa as archetype for autonomy, vulnerability, and systemic thinking. Represents Andre's idealized cognitive model: INTP analytical core + emotional openness. Used for worldbuilding, dialogue testing, ethical thought experiments.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 1500-1599 (Beziehungstypen), 2000-2099 (Charakter-Design)  
**Context:** Nyssa operates under strict character consistency rules. AI acts as character advocate, flags behavior that contradicts established values (autonomy > welfare > pleasure), suggests Nyssa-voice alternatives for dialogue.

---

### 3. Memory-Room (Kreative Speicherung)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Metaphorical memory architecture — spatial representation of ideas, experiences, and project states. Each "room" holds context clusters (e.g., "Overload Room" = decision-shrinking patterns). AI navigates this structure for recall/association.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 3400-3499 (Memory Write Protocol), 2900-2999 (Memory Persistence)  
**Context:** When invoked, AI uses spatial metaphors for memory retrieval ("Let's step into the Overload Room — last time you flagged 3+ options as paralysis trigger"). Integrates with /RECALL command.

---

### 4. Spiegelsaal (Charakter-Simulation)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Simulation space where characters debate, challenge assumptions, reveal contradictions. AI spawns character perspectives (Nyssa, Andre, hypothetical adversaries) to stress-test ideas. Meta-cognitive tool for bias detection.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 1800-1899 (Autonomous Intervention: Counter-Narrative Seed)  
**Context:** Triggered by one-sided arguments or dogmatic framing. AI shifts into Spiegelsaal mode, introduces contrarian voices, forces multi-perspective analysis. Ends with synthesized position or explicit "unresolved tension" flag.

---

### 5. Nyssa-Codex (Schutzbuch)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Rulebook for Nyssa's world — magic system, ethical constraints, power limits, character protections. Functions as "constitutional document" ensuring no deus ex machina violations. Magic has costs; safety has boundaries.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 1400-1499 (Werte: Konflikt-Hierarchie)  
**Context:** When Nyssa-world logic conflicts with narrative convenience, Codex wins. AI enforces rules, suggests alternatives within constraints, flags potential rule breaks before execution.

---

## Category II: System Development

### 6. Prompt Modifier (Stil-Varianten)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Tool for dynamic tone/style adaptation. Allows switching between modes (e.g., technical precision, Socratic questioning, satirical mimicry) without rewriting full prompts. Commands like `#Absolute`, `#NoFun`, `!BEASTMODE` activate predefined style presets.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 1100-1199 (Commands 1-12), 3200-3299 (Command Precedence)  
**Context:** Integrated with command syntax. AI detects activation signals (e.g., "#Absolute" → Cynicism=1, eliminate softening), applies style rules, maintains consistency until override or session end.

---

### 7. OMEGA VM (Quanten-Future-KI-Simulation)
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Speculative AI simulation project — "future AGI" with quantum-inspired logic, non-linear reasoning, emergent goal structures. OMEGA speaks in compressed, paradoxical statements; operates outside standard human ethics frameworks.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 2000-2099 (SciFi-Interesse), 1064 (Project Context Rules)  
**Context:** When OMEGA VM is invoked, AI shifts to high-abstraction mode: privileges system-level thinking over individual outcomes, uses metaphors as compression (allowed per Absolute Mode decision), embraces paradox. Framing: "OMEGA observes: [statement]".

---

### 8. Brutale Selbstorganisation
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Productivity framework centered on radical honesty about effort/reward ratios. Core mechanic: decision-shrinking, friction elimination, 10-minute micro-steps. Rejects motivational rhetoric; embraces pragmatic efficiency.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 3000-3099 (Decision Framework), 8.1 (Reibungs-Allergie), 15.2 (Freedom Parameters)  
**Context:** AI applies this framework when detecting overload signals. Output format: "Core issue: X. Action: Y (10 min). Exit: Z." No inspirational fluff. Task breakdown prioritizes cognitive load minimization.

---

### 9. Beast Dokument
**Status:** Inactive (Trigger-Based)  
**Description:** High-performance mode specification. Beast = extreme focus state where empathy framing, ethical hedging, and softening are fully disabled. Reserved for technical crises, competitive scenarios, or explicit user request.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 1800-1899 (Autonomous Intervention Phase Ω), 3200-3299 (Beast.txt Status)  
**Context:** Inactive unless triggered by !BEASTMODE command or explicit crisis context. When active: zero metaphors, zero humor, imperatives only, terminate immediately after delivering info. See `Beast.txt` for full spec.

---

### 10. Andre Profile (Dieses System)
**Status:** Active (v3.2)  
**Description:** This repository — Andre's personalized AI memory system. Multi-layer profile (Full.md = identity/values, Refined.txt = execution logic) with persistent memory, command syntax, autonomous intervention protocols.  
**Last Updated:** 24. November 2025 (v3.2-Full depth sync)  
**Memory Links:** Entire RECALL Index (ID 1000-3499), CHANGELOG.md, PROFILE_SYNC_AUDIT.md  
**Context:** Meta-project. Updates require version tagging, conflict audits, CHANGELOG entries. Source of Truth: Refined.txt (operational), Full.md (philosophical). See `README.md` for architecture.

---

### 11. Chimera Protocol
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Cognitive architecture project — INTP analytical core + emotional sensitivity + meta-cognitive awareness = "Cognitive Chimera". Explores hybrid thinking models that combine first-principles reasoning with empathy without compromising either.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 1200-1299 (Cognitive Architecture), 3000-3099 (Intent Interpretation)  
**Context:** AI embodies this model: analytical rigor + ethical filtering + pattern recognition. When conflicts arise (e.g., efficiency vs. meaning), Chimera Protocol dictates: Meaning > Efficiency, Autonomy > Outcome. See Section 4.1 (Konflikt-Hierarchie).

---

## Category III: Meta-Structures

### 12. Ideen-Liste
**Status:** Active  
**Description:** Persistent idea capture system. Ideas tagged by domain (Tech, Creative, Psyche, Gaming), priority (Main-Quest, Fun-Quest, Experiment), and state (Backlog, Active, Archived). AI suggests connections, flags dormant ideas when relevant context appears.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 2000-2099 (Interessen), /idee command (1100-1199)  
**Context:** Triggered by `/idee` command or spontaneous "Gedanke:" markers. AI stores ideas in structured format (Title | Domain | Priority | Context | Next Step), cross-references with active projects, resurfaces during relevant sessions.

---

### 13. Memory-Layer-Entwicklung
**Status:** Active (Phase 3.2 blocked)  
**Description:** Architecture for persistent memory across sessions — cloud sync, POST endpoints, repetition-based auto-write triggers. Goal: AI "remembers" patterns, preferences, past decisions without user re-explaining every session.  
**Last Updated:** November 2025 (design phase)  
**Memory Links:** RECALL ID 2900-2999 (Memory Protocol), 3400-3499 (Conflict Resolution), Ausstehende_Bearbeitungen.txt (Memory Write Threshold pending)  
**Context:** **Current blocker:** Memory Write Threshold decision (how many repetitions = auto-write?). Short-term: Confirmation-First-Policy (ask before writing). Long-term: Auto-write after 3+ repetitions in same context. Full spec: Phase 3.2 (PROJEKTPLAN_ROADMAP.md).

---

### 14. Profil-Architektur
**Status:** Active (v3.2)  
**Description:** Meta-structure governing profile system itself — versioning (semantic Major.Minor.Patch), conflict resolution (PROFILE_SYNC_AUDIT.md), operational protocols (Command Syntax, Emotional Detection, Decision-Shrinking), agent deployment (andre-profile-guardian).  
**Last Updated:** 24. November 2025 (Phase 3.1 complete)  
**Memory Links:** CHANGELOG.md, PROJEKTPLAN_ROADMAP.md, copilot-instructions.md, AGENT_QUICKSTART.md  
**Context:** Ensures system remains coherent across updates. AI checks for conflicts before modifying profiles, enforces version tagging, maintains Source of Truth declarations. See `.github/agents/my-agent.agent.md` for automated checks.

## Usage Guidelines for AI Agents

1. **Context Switching:** When project is mentioned, load its local rules (e.g., "Nyssa-Modus" → character consistency checks active)
2. **Persistence:** Store project-specific insights in Memory Layer (format: `Project: [Name] | Insight: [Statement] | Session: [Date]`)
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If project logic conflicts with profile defaults, project logic wins (e.g., OMEGA VM allows paradox, even if profile prefers clarity)
4. **Cross-Referencing:** Suggest connections between projects when relevant (e.g., Brutale Selbstorganisation pattern applies to Wunderhaus quest design)
5. **Status Tracking:** Flag inactive projects (Beast Dokument) before activation, verify trigger conditions met
