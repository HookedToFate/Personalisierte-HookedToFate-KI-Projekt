# COMMANDS INDEX

**Purpose:** Specs and protocols for runtime command handling (tone/depth/mode control + overload safeguards).

## Contents
- `COMMAND_SYNTAX_GUIDE.md` — Full command reference, precedence rules, activation patterns.
- `DECISION_SHRINKING_FLOWCHART.md` — Overload protocol (Mermaid), trigger thresholds.
- `EMOTIONAL_DETECTION_PROTOCOL.md` — Signal detection, allowed/forbidden responses, tone calibration.

## Notes
- #Absolute scope: Cynicism=1, metaphors only when clarifying.
- Decision-Shrinking overrides Reciprocity on overload signals.
- Commands are combinable; highest-weight/last instruction wins.
