# ARCHIVE INDEX

**Purpose:** Parking space for deprecated or historical materials that are not part of the active profile/archive tree.

**Current Status:** Empty. Profile-specific historical assets live in `profile/archive/`.

**Guideline:** Move inactive/legacy docs here instead of deleting. Add a short note (why archived, date) when you do.
